On the other, we have yet to develop good algorithms for many problems despite decades of effort, and for these problems we strive to prove no time- or space-efficient algorithms will ever solve them.

CSES is a hub of critical disability studies teaching and learning. The program provides students with theoretical and practical tools to study social, political, economic and historical injustices. CSES takes a unique approach to undergraduate education that values student experiential learning and community knowledge. The learning goal of CSES is to provide frameworks on theories of transformative social change rooted in political activism and formations of solidarity. The program encourages students to apply theory in action through organizing and practicing solidarity in making a more just world. Equity Studies creates a dynamic learning environment that extends far beyond the university walls. With a vibrant student body, dynamic faculty members, connection with a wide range of community partners and a bold curriculum, CSES at New College is a leader in studies of social justice, settler colonialism, race, gender, sexuality, disability, land/water and sustainability, activism, solidarity and the art of resistance, and global food equity and security.", "enrollment": "This is an open enrolment program.

Students learn about both basic and clinical pharmacology through lectures, tutorials and small group sessions.\nThis understanding prepares students for a variety of either research-based or non-research-based careers, including positions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in government agencies, in research institutes and in universities. Pharmacology (and its application in clinical therapeutics) plays a prominent role in society, and a comprehension of drug mechanisms and uses is fundamental to career success in the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing.

Courses take an integrative approach to understanding interactions between the solid Earth, the biosphere, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere, addressing how these interactions have developed over geological, historical, and recent time periods. Themes of the program include Earth surface processes (e.g., evolution of landforms and sedimentary basins), paleoclimatology (e.g., drivers of Earth’s natural climate variability), biogeochemistry, Quaternary science (understanding the ice ages) and global environmental change. This program provides broad context over time and space to better understand and provide solutions for the current issues of climate change, resource consumption and global pollution weighing heavily on people and societies.

CSES is a hub of critical disability studies teaching and learning. The program provides students with theoretical and practical tools to study social, political, economic and historical injustices. CSES takes a unique approach to undergraduate education that values student experiential learning and community knowledge. The learning goal of CSES is to provide frameworks on theories of transformative social change rooted in political activism and formations of solidarity. The program encourages students to apply theory in action through organizing and practicing solidarity in making a more just world. Equity Studies creates a dynamic learning environment that extends far beyond the university walls. With a vibrant student body, dynamic faculty members, connection with a wide range of community partners and a bold curriculum, CSES at New College is a leader in studies of social justice, settler colonialism, race, gender, sexuality, disability, land/water and sustainability, activism, solidarity and the art of resistance, and global food equity and security.", "enrollment": "This is an open enrolment program.

They learn how to build digital stories, exhibits, and maps; how to digitize rare books; how to analyze collections of data; how to construct digital models and 3D-print them; and how to manage major digital projects. By the end of the program, students conduct a major DH research project of their own or participate in the research of an established faculty project. Throughout the program, students gain a critical perspective on digital technologies, learning to consider the ways digital platforms shape, and are shaped by, the currents of wider social and cultural forces.\nBy providing this critical and technical skillset, the Digital Humanities Minor prepares students for future paths that range from graduate studies in literature, history, library science, education, or computer science, to careers as technical writers, data analysts and visualizers, project managers, or programmers.\nStudents should note that some courses at the 200, 300, and 400 levels may have additional prerequisites.\nPermission to count courses that are not on the list below towards the Minor in Digital Humanities must be received from the Program Coordinator, and will be granted on a case-by-case basis when the student’s work demonstrably and substantially engages Digital Humanities-related content or research methods.", "enrollment": "This is an open enrolment program.

A data scientist extracts information from data, and is involved with every step that must be taken to achieve this goal, from getting acquainted with the data to communicating the results in non-technical language. The Data Science Specialist program prepares students for work in the Data Science industry or government and for graduate studies in Data Science, Computer Science, or Statistics. Students in the program will benefit from a range of advanced courses in Computer Science and Statistics offered by the University of Toronto, as well as from a sequence of three integrative courses designed especially for the program.\nThe Data Science Specialist program comprises three fundamental and highly-integrated aspects. First, students will acquire expertise in statistical reasoning, methods, and inference essential for any data analyst. Seconds, students will receive in-depth training in computer science: the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for handling large amounts of data, and best practices in software design. Students will receive training in machine learning, which lies at the intersection of computer and statistical sciences. The third aspect is the application of computer science and statistics to produce analyses of complex, large-scale datasets, and the communication of the results of these analyses; students will receive training in these areas by taking integrative courses that are designed specifically for the Data Science Specialist program. The courses involve experiential learning: students will be working with real large-scale datasets from the domain of business, government, and/or science. The successful student will combine their expertise in computer and statistical science to produce and communicate analyses of complex large-scale datasets.\nSkills that graduates of the program will acquire include proficiency in statistical reasoning and computational thinking; data manipulation and exploration, visualization, and communication that are required for work as a data scientist; the ability to apply statistical methods to solve problems in the context of scientific research, business, and government; familiarity and experience with best practices in software development; and knowledge of current software infrastructure for handling large data sets. Graduates of the program will be able to demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning algorithms to large-scale datasets that arise in scientific research, government, and business; create appropriate data visualizations for complex datasets; identify and answer questions that involve applying statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to complex data, and communicating the results; present the results and limitations of a data analysis at an appropriate technical level for the intended audience.", "enrollment": "This is a limited enrolment program.

The Specialist program integrates knowledge of pharmacology – the understanding of the therapeutic properties and clinical applications of externally administered chemical substances in the whole body and the mechanisms of their actions and interactions with their intended targets, while biomedical toxicology examines the harmful effects of exogenous chemicals on the health and behaviour of individuals and society, addressing drug safety and the adverse consequences of chemical exposure. Biomedical toxicology includes understanding the safety/toxicity of a wide array of chemicals (pharmaceutical preparations, herbal products, natural toxins and environmental contaminants) with a focus on their effects and adverse consequences on human health.\nBoth Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology are integrative life sciences which build on the core foundational disciplines of the basic life sciences and the prominent role each science plays in society. A comprehension of the biological mechanisms of action and potential uses of chemicals are key to career success in the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing. The Specialist program prepares students for a variety of job opportunities following its completion as well as for further study in graduate research or professional programs such as Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. (Note: Students interested in professional programs should contact the respective faculties to inquire about specific transfer credits.) Graduates of this rigorous program will have access to an impressive variety of job opportunities in either research-based or non-research-based careers, including scientific research in research institutes and in universities, positions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical industries, forensic science, nutrition and food sciences, government or consulting agencies. Students learn about both basic and clinical pharmacology and biomedical toxicology through lectures, tutorials, small group sessions, laboratories and independent research projects.

The safety/toxicity of a wide array of chemicals is examined including pharmaceutical preparations, herbal products, natural toxins and environmental contaminants, with a focus on their effects on human health. This program emphasizes the application of toxicological knowledge and risk assessment and prepares students for a variety of job opportunities following its completion as well as for further study in graduate research or professional programs such as Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. (Note: Students interested in professional programs should contact the respective faculties to inquire about specific transfer credits.) Many graduates of the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist program pursue careers in scientific research, forensic science, nutrition and food sciences, governmental agencies, consulting agencies, and industrial settings including the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Students learn about basic and clinical toxicology and related areas through lectures, tutorials, laboratories, and independent research projects.

The program explores the role of commerce in modern society while developing skill and confidence in analysis, effective communication, and decision making. The Rotman Commerce program offers a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree in three different specialist programs, Finance & Economics, Accounting, and Management.\nAll programs within the Bachelor of Commerce degree build on a common foundation of business and liberal arts courses. Rotman Commerce students specialize in one of three programs: Accounting, Finance and Economics, or Management. Each program combines courses in management and applied economics with a variety of advanced courses in the liberal arts and sciences. The balance assures graduates of a solid understanding of business and modern society along with a command of critical skills in decision-making and organizational leadership.\nRotman Commerce graduates frequently become economists, accountants, actuaries, financial analysts, marketing analysts, managers of firms and government, or proprietors of small businesses. Some Rotman Commerce students elect to undertake post-graduate studies in the form of further university education: law schools and MBA programs have been particularly favoured destinations of recent graduates.", "enrollment": "This is a limited enrolment program.

They will be able to write imaginatively, compellingly, clearly, and effectively, and to produce creative work in a range of literary and dramatic modes, genres, and forms.

Students currently enrolled in the program will be allowed to continue.  The Interactive Digital Media (IDM) program explores the transformation of knowledge and culture through critical examinations of the social impacts of new and emerging communication and information technologies.  IDM is run jointly by the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) and the Faculty of Information (iSchool) at the University of Toronto.  By integrating critical communication and information studies, the program confronts information and communications technologies (ICTs) as elements of larger social-technical systems of power.  Students engage in debates over digital culture, surveillance and privacy, internet governance and policy, intellectual property, human-computer interaction, information systems design, and the rhetoric of innovation and technological development.  IDM takes an interdisciplinary approach to this exploration, addressing telecommunications and other media infrastructure; institutionalized practices of entertainment and sociability; and techniques of data collection, management, and analysis practices.\r In addition to the CORE courses, students will be required to take an integrated set of upper level courses providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and critique complex technical, political, and cultural responses to the opportunities and dangers of new and enduring information practices.\rWithin an Honour's degree, 13.0 credits are required.\n    \nLimited Enrolment\n    --Students may apply to enrol after having completed this program's requirements in the first year with a grade of 65% in both CCT109H5 and CCT110H5.

IDM is run jointly by the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) and the Faculty of Information (iSchool) at the University of Toronto.  By integrating critical communication and information studies, the program confronts information and communications technologies (ICTs) as elements of larger social-technical systems of power.  Students engage in debates over digital culture, surveillance and privacy, internet governance and policy, intellectual property, human-computer interaction, information systems design, and the rhetoric of innovation and technological development.  IDM takes an interdisciplinary approach to this exploration, addressing telecommunications and other media infrastructure; institutionalized practices of entertainment and sociability; and techniques of data collection, management, and analysis practices.\r In addition to the CORE courses, students will be required to take an integrated set of upper level courses providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and critique complex technical, political, and cultural responses to the opportunities and dangers of new and enduring information practices.\rWithin an Honour's degree, 13.0 credits are required.\n    \nLimited Enrolment\n    --Students may apply to enrol after having completed this program's requirements in the first year with a grade of 65% in both CCT109H5 and CCT110H5.

Students can combine an undergraduate program offered by the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto Mississauga with the Master of Arts in Child Study and Education program offered through the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.\r\nThe Combined Degree Program permits the completion of both degrees in six years and allows students to count one full graduate credit (1.0 FCE) toward both their undergraduate and graduate degrees. \r\nMinimum Admission Requirements Applicants must apply to and be accepted by the HBSc program at UTM and the MA-CSE program. Applicants must satisfy the admission requirements of each program. Undergraduate students apply to the master's program in January of third year.\rStudents must be enrolled full-time in the HBSc program and be in good standing with a minimum AGPA of 3.7 in Year 3 to be admissible; students are expected to carry a full course load of 5.0 full-course equivalents (FCEs), including 1.0 FCE at OISE in the summer term between Year 3 and Year 4.\rQualified students in Year 3 of the HBSc program may apply to the MA-CSE program; those accepted will receive a conditional offer to commence the MA-CSE program when the HBSc program requirements have been completed and all other conditions are met. \rAdmission into the MA-CSE program will have the following four conditions: students must (1) maintain an A- average (AGPA 3.7) or higher in Year 4 of the HBSc, (2) have an average grade of at least B+ in the graduate courses taken at OISE in the Summer term between Year 3 and Year 4, (3) demonstrate HBSc degree conferral; and (4) meet experiential learning qualifications of working with children as specified by the MA-CSE program (see program website for detailed admission package requirements).\r\nProgram Requirements Students in the combined program must meet the full academic program requirements of both the HBSc and MA-CSE programs.\rStudents must be registered full-time, enrolling in 5.0 full-course equivalents (FCEs) each year of the undergraduate program, including 1.0 FCE from the MA-CSE program in the summer term between Year 3 and Year 4 that will count towards the HBSc degree.\rIn Year 5, students who meet the requirements to lift the conditions of admission will commence the MA-CSE program and will count the 1.0 FCE of MA-CSE program electives taken in the summer between Year 3 and Year 4 toward the MA-CSE program requirements.\r\nStudents admitted to the CDP follow the academic path to completion outlined below.\r\nFirst Year:\nCurricular Path:\nUndergraduate courses in accordance with the U of T regulations for the Psychology (Major), HBSc program.\r\nSpecific Requirements:\n5.0 full-course equivalents (FCEs) toward the HBSc program and degree requirements.

Through common core courses and courses unique to each stream, students consider the ubiquity of media in contemporary society and examine media’s cultural, political, economic, and social implications. Because media is centrally placed as a means through which democratic discussion occurs in the public sphere, the development of media literacy skills is crucial in maintaining an informed citizenry and paramount to students’ individual empowerment.\n\nAs media scholar W.

The Program is cross-disciplinary; public policy analysis is the exercise of applying the theoretical frameworks and the positivist and interpretive methodologies of the social sciences and humanities to understand the development, implementation, and evaluation of public policy. It requires the ability to think clearly and critically, to design and execute research projects, to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, and to write clearly. It also requires an understanding of the context, institutions, and processes of policy-making and implementation, as well as concepts and criteria for policy evaluation.In addition to their academic course requirements, students must successfully complete the additive Arts & Science Co-op Work Term Preparation courses and a minimum of two Co-op work terms.

These courses are designed to prepare students for their job search and work term experience, and to maximize the benefits of their Co-op work terms. They cover a variety of topics intended to assist students in developing the skills and tools required to secure work terms that are appropriate to their program of study, and to perform professionally in the workplace. These courses must be completed in sequence, and are taken in addition to a full course load. They are recorded on transcripts as credit/no credit (CR/NCR) and are considered to be additive credit to the 20.0 required degree credits.

Stehlik Email: biodiversity@utsc.utoronto.ca\nThis program presents a foundation for understanding how ecology and evolution shape organismal features (from morphology and physiology to behaviour) and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. Ultimately these processes determine the broad patterns of organization of life on earth and biodiversity. The challenges to biodiversity are daunting. Habitat destruction, biological invasions and climate change are causing loss of species and disruption of ecosystems worldwide. Graduates are trained to understand and actively seek solutions to these problems. This program will show how ecological and evolutionary perspectives can be used to understand and predict the outcome of dynamic interactions among organisms, populations, species, and communities. Students will be well trained to take positions in government agencies, consulting firms or NGO's, able to continue with graduate studies in science for academic careers, or able to pursue careers in business or law related to environmental issues, stewardship and sustainable development.\nNote: This program was formerly known as the Specialist in Biodiversity, Ecology & Evolution (BSc).", "enrollment": "Students apply to the Specialist Program in Conservation and Biodiversity after completing a minimum of 4.0 credits, including 1.0 credit in Biology (excluding BIOA11H3), 1.0 credit in Chemistry, and 0.5 credit in Mathematics (excluding MATA02H3) or Statistics and with a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of at least 2.0.\nApplication for admission is made to the Office of the Registrar through ACORN, in April/May and July/August.

All PMD courses are taught at Centennial College. Note, some PMD courses require that 60% be achieved in all components of the course (i.e., lecture component, practical component, and clinical-placement component).\nNote: In order to remain in the program, students must typically maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Students whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 should consult the program supervisor to discuss their options. Please also note, space in some Centennial College courses is limited. Students who must repeat one of these courses and whose cumulative GPA has fallen below 2.0 will be allowed to register in these courses only if space permits.\nSuggested Course Sequence\nYear 1: Fall Semester*\nBIOA01H3 Life on Earth: Unifying Principles\nCHMA10H3 Introductory Chemistry I: Structure and Bonding\nPSYA01H3 Introduction to Biological and Cognitive Psychology\nYear 1: Winter Semester*\nBIOA02H3 Life on Earth: Form, Function and Interactions\nCHMA11H3 Introductory Chemistry II; Reactions and Mechanisms\nPSYA02H3 Introduction to Clinical, Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology\n*In Year 1 students must also complete 0.5 credit in statistics [STAB22H3 Statistics I or PSYB07H3 Data Analysis in Psychology].\nYear 2: Fall Semester\nBIOB10H3 Cell Biology\nPMDB33H3 Anatomy\nPMDB22H3 Pre-Hospital Care 1: Theory and Lab\nPMDB25H3 Therapeutic Approaches to Behaviour in Crisis\nPMDB41H3 Professional Issues, Research and Leadership\nYear 2: Winter Semester\nBIOB11H3 Molecular Aspects of Genetic Processes\nPMDB30H3 Alterations of Human Body Function I\nPMDB32Y3 Pre-Hospital Care 2: Theory, Lab and Clinical\nPMDB36H3 Pharmacology for Allied Health Pre-requisite\nYear 3: Fall Semester\nBIOB34H3 Animal Physiology\nPMDC40H3 Alterations in Human Body Function II\nPMDC42Y3 Pre-Hospital Care 3: Theory, Lab and Field\nPMDC43H3 Medical Directed Therapeutics and Paramedic Responsibilities\nYear 3: Winter Semester\nBIOC17H3 Microbiology\nBIOC34H3 Human Physiology II\nPMDC54Y3 Pre-Hospital Care 4: Theory, Lab and Field\nPMDC56H3 Primary Care Practice Integration and Decision Making\nYear 4: Fall Semester\nBIOC21H3 Vertebrate Histology: Cells and Tissues or BIOC32H3 Human Physiology I\nPSYB20H3 Introduction to Developmental Psychology\nPSYB32H3 Abnormal Psychology\n[BIOD33H3 Comparative Animal Physiology or BIOD65H3 Pathologies of the Nervous System or BIOD26H3 Fungal Biology and Pathogenesis or BIOD96Y3 Directed Research in Paramedicine*]\nYear 4: Winter Semester\nPSYC08H3 Advanced Data Analysis in Psychology\nBIOD17H3 Seminars in Cellular Microbiology or BIOD43H3 Animal Movement and Exercise or BIOD29H3 Pathobiology of Human Disease\n0.5 credits of elective courses\n*Students may take any 2 of the D-level courses listed above to meet program requirements.
